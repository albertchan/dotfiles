# dotfiles

Useful dotfiles for Mac OS X and Debian environments.

## Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. For example, you can keep it in
`~/Developer/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink. The bootstrapper script 
will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/albertchan/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

If `bootstrap.sh` is for some reason not executable, run:

```
chmod +x boostrap.sh
```
